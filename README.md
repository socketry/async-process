# Async::Process

Implements `Process.spawn` and `Process.capture` for [async](https://github.com/socketry/async).

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/async-process/workflows/Development/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/async-process/actions?workflow=Development)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'async-process'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install async-process

## Usage

In any asynchronous context (e.g. a reactor), simply use the `Async::Process.spawn` rather than `Process.spawn` like so:

``` ruby
require 'async/process'

Async::Reactor.run do
	status = Async::Process.spawn("ls", "-lah")
end
```

Internally, we use a thread, since `nio4r` doesn't support monitoring pids.
